# Invoice Maker
### Problem Statement
Many individuals engaged in side jobs or small-scale businesses often find themselves in need of crafting polished invoices and professional shipping labels. Although it's feasible to accomplish this task using common software like Microsoft Office or LibreOffice, the quality of the resulting documents depends heavily on the user's design skills. Moreover, the process of generating an invoice and shipping label with readily available, budget-friendly tools can be unnecessarily time consuming, involving numerous repetitive steps like inputting the shipping address twiceâ€”once on the invoice and again on the shipping label. While not particularly challenging, this process can be streamlined for greater efficiency. 

Enter Invoice Maker, designed to simplify this entire process. It offers an integrated solution that empowers users to effortlessly create invoices and automatically generate shipping labels, all while utilizing information already stored or entered during the invoice creation process.
